# autodrone
My project thesis, aiming to take off and land a drone autonomously on a moving
platform.

## Usage

To start the Sphinx simulator run

```
./sphinx/start.sh
```

To run a program in the simulator, first start the Olympe environment in a 
terminal

```
source olympe/start.sh
python3 src/simple_test.py
```
